# Contributing to Simple AOS

## Bugs

Found a bug? Have a problem with AOS? Please check past issues, maybe someone already had that problem. If you don't find a similar issue create new, but remember to add accurate information so that I can dig into it straight away. If it's possible to add a CodePen example that presents called issue.

## Development process

### Setup

- Install all dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Build the package:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

### Commiting changes

If all tests are passing then you're good to go. Commit your changes, but remember to **not commit `dist` folder**.
Create well described Pull Request with as many information as possible and wait for my answer :) I'd be happy to make a code review and put some thoughts.
